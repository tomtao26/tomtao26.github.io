<br>
Recently, I encountered an interesting problem from an interview<!-- from Lancaster University-->.
The requirement is like this:
<pre>
"Try to figure out how many memory operations in a specific method."
</pre>
<h2> 1. Analyze the problem </h2>

I should build a tool to solve such problem.
In order to count the memory operations dynamically, 
the tool should have the following PARTS:
<ul>
<li> Detect where the memory operations are</li>
<li> A snippet of code to count</li>
<li> A global counter or several decentralized counters</li>
</ul>

It seems easy in logic: just add the counter when the tool detect a memory operation.
However, there are two challenges left:
<ol>
<li> How can you detect a memory operation?</li>
<li> Where should the counter place? </li>
</ol>

<p>
Basically, there are four levels of abstraction in such environment.
And the tool can detect the memory operation in any layer theoratically.<br>
-----------------<br>
|  Application  |<br>
-----------------<br>
|&nbsp; &nbsp;Java VM &nbsp;  |<br>
-----------------<br>
|&nbsp;    OS   Kernel  &nbsp;|<br>
-----------------<br>
|    Hypervisor &nbsp;|<br>
-----------------<br>
</p>

<p>
For the <em>first challenges</em>, there are several solutions coming into my mind.
The most straight forward way is to modifying the java virtual machine, and
increase the counter every time when a memory operation is encountered. However,
it is hard both in the implementation(considering JIT) and using(user have to replace
his/her JVM). Another total transparent way is to utilize emulator or VM such as Qemu
or KVM/XEN. However, this is also hard to achieve since such scheme will detect all the memory operations
including the memory operations from the JVM it self(GC, JIT and so on) or OS kernel.
There is also a solution based on hacking OS kernel. The kernel can assign all the memory pages
to read only to get the write operations and assign all the memory pages to null to get all the read operations.
Nevertheless, it is obviously a crazy idea.
</p>

<p>Above all, the most suitable solution should be instrumenting the memory operations at
Java bytecode level, which will preserve the semantic of the application and eliminate the 
noise from the JVM(JIT/GC).
</p>

<p>
The <em>second challenge</em> is also solved by realizing to detect memory operations at Java
bytecode level. I should maintain the counter inside the applications rather than keep it in 
JVM/OS/Hypervisor. Dynamically inserting a field to a globally reachable class or to each of the 
instrumented classes should both be OK.
</p>

<h2>2. Background</h2>
<h3>Java Bytecode Instrumentation</h3>
I use BCEL(Byte Code Engineering Library).

<h3>BCEL Basic</h3>

A quick and easy to follow tutorial is h<a href="http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bcel/manual.html">here</a>.

<h2>3. Design and Implementation of the Tool</h2>
As I described in the problem analysis, this tool should be 
partitioned into three parts: counter adding, memory operation detecting and
counting snippet inserting.

<h3>Counter Adding</h3>

<p> 
I choose to insert decentralized counter to each classes.
In this way, this tool can differentiate the memory operations in different calsses.
</p>

<p>
Here is my code:</p>
<code>
FieldGen rc = new FieldGen(Constants.ACC_PUBLIC|Constants.ACC_STATIC, Type.INT,"memop_read_counter",cPoolGen);<br>
FieldGen wc = new FieldGen(Constants.ACC_PUBLIC|Constants.ACC_STATIC, Type.INT,"memop_write_counter",cPoolGen);<br>
classGen.addField(rc.getField());<br>
classGen.addField(wc.getField());<br>
int rindex = cPoolGen.addFieldref(classGen.getClassName(), "memop_read_counter", "I");<br>
int windex = cPoolGen.addFieldref(classGen.getClassName(), "memop_write_counter", "I");<br>
</code>

<p>
Variable "cPoolGen" is the ConstantPoolGen of the class you want to instrument. "classGen" 
is the ClassGen of the class. "rindex" and "windex" are the index of the field in the constant pool,
which will help during the counting snippet.
</p>

<h3>Memory Operation Detecting</h3>

<p>
In order to detect the memory operations in the application, you should first 
be aware who are they. The following are the memory opcodes I find in Java specification.
</p>

<code>
String[] instrumentOps = {"GETFIELD","PUTFIELD",
			"AASTORE","ASTORE","BASTORE","CASTORE","DASTORE",
			"DSTORE","FASTORE","FSTORE","IASTORE","ISTORE","LASTORE","LSTORE","SASTORE",
			"AALOAD","ALOAD","BALOAD","CALOAD","DALOAD",
			"DLOAD","FALOAD","FLOAD","IALOAD","ILOAD","LALOAD","LLOAD","SALOAD"
			};
</code>

<p>
After deciding which memory operation to instrument, we should try to find these operations
in application.
</p>

<pre>
MethodGen methodGen = new MethodGen(methods[i], clazz.getClassName(), cPoolGen); 
InstructionList list = methodGen.getInstructionList();
//search for the memory op
InstructionFinder insf = new InstructionFinder(list);
for(Iterator it = insf.search(pattern); it.hasNext(); ) {
	//do instrumentation
	...	
}
</pre>

<p>
In this code snippet, "for(Iterator it = insf.search(pattern); it.hasNext();)" is trying to
find all the instructions following the "pattern". The patter is a regular expression. Here
the pattern is like "GETFIELD | PUTFEILD | ...".
</p>

<h3>Counting Snippet Inserting</h3>

<p>The goal of the counting snippet is to increase the counter without harming
the correctness of the original application. JVM is a stack based virtual machine,
which you should manipulate the oprand stack carefully.</p>

<pre>
private void instrumentOp(InstructionList list, InstructionHandle curop, int lv){
	//the comments is the status of the stack
	curop = list.append(curop, new GETSTATIC(lv)); //rcounter
	curop = list.append(curop, new ICONST(1)); //rcounter,1
	curop = list.append(curop, new IADD()); //rcounter+1
	curop = list.append(curop, new PUTSTATIC(lv)); //...
}<br>
</pre>

<p>
The parameters for this function are:<br>
&nbsp;	list: the list of bytecode from one certain method in class<br>
&nbsp;	curop: the cursor pointing to the memory operation which should be instrumented<br>
&nbsp;	lv: the counting variable index (e.g. rindx, windex)<br>
</p>
<p>
The meaning of the code is:<br>
&nbsp;(1) finding the static counting variable and push it to stack<br>
&nbsp;(2) push 1 into the stack<br>
&nbsp;(3) pop the first two elements on stack, add them and push back the result<br>
&nbsp;(4) pop the first element on the stack, and set it to the static variable<br>
</p>

<h3>Classloader</h3>

<p>
With the tool above, we can successfully tracking all the memory operations in a Java program.
However, when should we invoke our tool? Of course, we can run it to generate a new static class
file for user to use. But this is not convenience to run manually.
A cooler solution is to extends the classloader and dynamically rewrite the class structure in 
memory.
</p>

<h2>4. Some Details</h2>

<h3>Stack Size</h3>

The maximum stack size of each method in Java is calculated by the compiler.
However, our instrumentation may break that rule and overflow the stack.
In this case, we should extend the maximum size of the stack.

<pre>
//reset the stack size
methodGen.setMaxStack(methodGen.getMaxStack()+2);
</pre>

<h3>Verifier in JDK7</h3>

The JDK7 uses a more strict verifier.
Our naive way of instrumenting will break the structure of StackMap.
A simple bypass is to fake the classes in a previous version,
which will loose the verification during executing.

<pre>
//using low version, bypass stackMap
classGen.setMajor(50);
</pre>

<h3>Collecting the Result</h3>
How to collect the result from the different classes is another problem.
I use the callback function of Java at the end of the program to collect 
all the counters.
<pre>
Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread() {
	public void run() {
		//your code here
	}
});
</pre>
