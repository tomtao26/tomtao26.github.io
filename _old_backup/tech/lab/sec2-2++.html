<h1>Part 1: THREAD NOTIONS IN DIFFERENT ABSTRACTIONS</h1>

<p>Thread is an important concept in nowadays programming model. 
Java uses its own thread model to create and synchronized all the behaviors of the threads. The java's official guide is <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/">HERE</a>, and a quick tutorial is <a href="http://www.vogella.com/articles/JavaConcurrency/article.html">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>In short, java thread model has the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li> A language level thread abstraction</li>
<li> Syntax "synchronized" as the synchronization primitive </li>
<li> Every object has a lock field, which means all the object can be used as a lock</li>
<li> Library based atomic operations </li>
</ul>

<p> In this section, implementation of the thread model in different level will be discussed.
General speaking, there are four level of abstractions of threads top-down:
(1) Language level (2) Virtual Machine level (3) library level (4) kernel level.
</p>

<h2> Thread in Java:</h2>
<p>
The main class used by developers is Thread whose source code is in the file libcore/luni/src/main/java/java/lang/Thread.java.
However, if you see deep into the code,
this is only a wrapper for the real thread. 
It abstracts some interfaces for developers.
Another important class is called VMThread whose function is obvious from its name. 
It manages the thread structure in virtual machine through JNI bridge.
</p>

<h2> Thread in Dalvik:</h2>
<P>
As described above, class VMThread is the thread's delegate in Java level.
It jump into c++ code by calling the native function in file dalvik/vm/native/java_lang_VMThread.cpp.
This file needs your special attention, because it is the door to the world of Dalvik threads.
</P>
<p>
The data structure is alway the first part of code you should understand.
The thread's data structure is defined in head file dalvik/vm/Thread.h.
It seems a little complicated. Nevertheless, the comments here give you a lot of help to understand 
the function of each field. After brief reading of the structure, you should start reading the code 
at the function dvmCreateInterpThread(...) in file dalvik/vm/Thread.cpp. 
This is the entry of creating a virtual machine thread. 
In this function, a new vm thread will be created and linked with a new pthread thread.
After the initialization, it will directly call the run() overrided by its child.
</p>
<p>
When you reading the code, try to answer following questions in mind:
<ul>
	<li>When does the code leave the c++ and return to the Java world?</li>
	<li>Where are the thread in Dalvik and a pthread linked together?</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> Thread in pthread and kernel: </h2>
<p>
The pthread library is implemented in the bionic project.
Most of the code which may interest you is placed at file bionic/libc/bionic/pthread.c.
The data structure of thread in pthread library is called pthread_internal_t defined in file bionic/libc/bionic/pthread_internal.h.
Pthread library uses system call clone to fork a thread. 
Thread is very similar to the conception of process nowadays except they do not have their own address space.
All the threads in the same process share the memory addresses with each other.
This can be bot good (easy programming) and bad (heavy contention on memory layout data structure).
</p>
<p>
We do not mention the structure of thread in kernel here, because default source code of Android do not include such files.
While many articles talked about the design and implement of thread structure in kernel.
It is pretty convenient to find them.
</p>
<p>
Above all, from this perspective, all the abstractions in language, virtual machine and library are all wrappers of thread entity in kernel.
However, this is not always the case. In the preliminary version of JVM, virtual machine maintains its own threads 
in its own process and does all the scheduling itself. It seems no good other than increasing complexity to do this.
However, there are some reasons for this.
Maintaining the threads in higher level have some performance benefit in a situation with huge amount of threads.
This is because creating threads and scheduling them in kernel is not free. 
Trapping into kernel is often an unwelcoming behavior. 
And the memory contention is another reason to keep thread more lightweight.
For other language, we can also see the feature similar to thread but more simple, such as coroutine.
And this is maintained inside virtual machine most of the time, such as Lua.
