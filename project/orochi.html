<p>
You put a program on a concurrent server, but you don't trust
the server; later, you get a trace of the actual requests that
the server received from its clients and the responses that
it delivered. You separately get logs from the server; these
are untrusted. How can you use the logs to efficiently verify
that the responses were derived from running the program
on the requests? This is the Efficient Server Audit Problem,
which abstracts real-world scenarios, including running a
web application on an untrusted provider. We give a solution
based on several new techniques, including simultaneous
replay and efficient verification of concurrent executions. We
implement the solution for PHP web applications. For several
applications, our verifier achieves 5.6--10.9x speedup versus
simply re-executing, with <10% overhead for the server.
