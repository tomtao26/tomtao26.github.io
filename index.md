  I'm a Postdoctoral Researcher in LSE, mentored/hosted by Prof. [László Végh](https://personal.lse.ac.uk/veghl/). 
  I received my Ph.D. from NYU in 2020, advised by Prof. [Richard Cole](https://cs.nyu.edu/cole/).
  I'm interested in Algorithmic Game Theory and Optimization.
  Before coming to NYU, I received my BS degree in Computer Science from ACM Honor Class at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
